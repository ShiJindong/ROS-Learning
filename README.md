# ROS-Learning
---
Used ROS-Version: Melodic

At first:

      cd ros_ws
      catkin_make
      source devel/setup.bash
      roscore
  
or:
      
      cd tools_ws
      catkin_make
      source devel/setup.bash
      roscore
      
Then rosrun rosnodes or roslaunch launch files.

The executable rosnodes are implemented not only with C++ but also with Python.
